        <h2>Welcome to the Natural Park</h2>
        <section>
            <p>
                The Natural Park of Sierra Bicuerca, reserve of the biosphere, is an obligated reference to the mediterranean
                forests and internal scrublands, and a habitat to the native flora and fauna.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was declared a natural park in 1983, with a surface of 9.090 hectares. Being one of the more extensive enclaves of the Comunidad Valenciana.
                With a great thickness of vegetation and many rivulets, it offers an ideal climate for both terrestrial and aquatic species.
                Its forests, of holm oak and pine trees, house wide bird colonies.
            </p>
            <p>
                In between the many species of the park, we can highlight one of the latest griffon vulture colonies in the zone. We will also find ourselves
                constently overflown by the peregrine falcon or the Bonelli's eagle. As we get close to the rivulets, we will see numerous boar and deer 
                footprints, and if we don't make too much noise, it's not hard to spot some drinking under the attentive stare of the kingfisher, waiting
                for the clueless trout.
