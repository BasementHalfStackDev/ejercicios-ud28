        <h2>Species of the park</h2>
        <section>
            <p>These are some of the inhabitants of the park:</p>
        <h3>Otter</h3>
        <p>
            The European/Palearctic Otter (Lutra lutra) is a carnivorous mammal of aquatic habitat. It feeds on fishes, frogs and small prey it hunts in the river.
            Near their hideouts, we can see slides they create to rapidly get to the water.
        </p>
        <h3>Griffon Vulture</h3>
        <p>
            The Griffon Vulture (Gyps fulvus) is a bird of prey, one of the biggest ones you can find in the Iberian Peninsula. Its main diet consists on
            carrion that it spots with its sharp eyesight.
        </p>
        <h3>Genet</h3>
        <p>
            The genet (Genetta genetta) is a species of carnivore mammal. They are great climbers, very agile and excellent small animal hunters.
            Although they also feed on fruits of the forest they can find in the park.
